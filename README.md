## Prerequisites

The only thing you need installed on your machine to run this project is **Docker Desktop**. Everything else (Node.js, PostgreSQL, npm packages) runs inside containers.

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Docker Desktop** | 4.x or later | Includes Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2 |
| **Git** | Any recent version | To clone the repository |

> **Windows users:** Docker Desktop requires WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Docker Desktop installs this automatically during setup. Make sure Docker Desktop is running (whale icon in system tray) before running any `docker` commands.

> **No need to install:** Node.js, npm, PostgreSQL, or any other runtime. Docker handles everything.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Backend API | Node.js + TypeScript + Express | Node 20 LTS |
| ORM | Prisma | 5.22 |
| Database | PostgreSQL | 16 |
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS | Next.js 14 |
| Container runtime | Docker Compose | v2 (included in Docker Desktop) |
| Base image (backend) | Debian Bookworm Slim | `node:20-bookworm-slim` |
| Base image (frontend) | Alpine | `node:20-alpine` |

> **Why Debian for the backend?** Prisma 5's query engine is compiled against glibc + OpenSSL. Alpine Linux uses musl libc and cannot load Prisma's native binary without additional packages. The Debian slim image resolves this reliably without requiring Alpine hacks.

---

## Quick Start (Docker — one command)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd erp-invoicing

docker compose up --build
```

That's it. Docker will:
1. Pull `postgres:16-alpine` and start the database
2. Build the backend image (Debian slim + Node 20 + TypeScript compile)
3. Run `prisma migrate deploy` (creates all tables)
4. Run the seed script (creates 8 demo invoices across all lifecycle states — PAID, PARTIALLY_PAID, SENT overdue, SENT current, APPROVED, DRAFT, VOID, WRITTEN_OFF — with real GL journal entries and payments)
5. Start the Express API on port 3001
6. Build the frontend image and start Next.js on port 3000

Watch for `✅ Seed complete!` in the logs, then open the app.

**To run in detached mode (background):**
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f backend   # watch seed output
```

Services:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:3001
- **Health check:** http://localhost:3001/health

> **No manual steps needed.** Migrations and seed data run automatically on first start. The frontend auto-detects the tenant — no configuration required.

---

## Running Tests (no Docker required)

Tests run entirely against mocked Prisma — no database needed.

```bash
cd backend
npm ci          # install dependencies
npm test        # run 52 tests
```

Expected output: **52 tests pass, 0 failures** in ~10 seconds.

Requires Node.js 20+ installed locally (only needed if you want to run tests without Docker).

---

## Local Development (without Docker)

### Prerequisites for local dev
- Node.js 20+ — https://nodejs.org
- PostgreSQL 16 running locally (or point `DATABASE_URL` at any PostgreSQL 16 instance)

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Copy and configure env
cp .env.example .env
# Edit DATABASE_URL if needed

# Generate Prisma client + run migrations
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

# Seed demo data (prints tenant/entity/customer IDs)
npm run db:seed

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Only API URL is needed — tenant is auto-detected from the /api/tenants endpoint
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001" > .env.local

npm run dev
```

---

## API Reference & Sample Requests

> **Important:** All business routes require `X-Tenant-ID` header.  
> Get your tenant ID from the seed script output.

Set these variables before running the examples:

```bash
TENANT_ID="<from seed output>"
ENTITY_ID="<from seed output>"
CUSTOMER_ID="<from seed output>"
AR_ACCOUNT_ID="<from seed output>"
CASH_ACCOUNT_ID="<from seed output>"
BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"
```

> **Role headers:** `POST` endpoints that change state enforce RBAC via `X-User-Role`.  
> AR_CLERK can create invoices and payments. CONTROLLER is required for approve, void, and write-off.  
> Omitting the header defaults to VIEWER (read-only).

### 1. Create an Invoice

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/invoices" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: $TENANT_ID" \
  -H "X-User-Role: AR_CLERK" \
  -H "X-User-ID: user-001" \
  -H "X-User-Name: Jane Accountant" \
  -d '{
    "entityId": "'$ENTITY_ID'",
    "customerId": "'$CUSTOMER_ID'",
    "dueDate": "2024-08-31",
    "currency": "USD",
    "idempotencyKey": "inv-create-001",
    "lineItems": [
      {
        "description": "Enterprise License Q3 2024",
        "quantity": 1,
        "unitPrice": 10000.00,
        "taxRate": 0.08,
        "glAccountId": "<revenue-account-id>"
      },
      {
        "description": "Implementation Services",
        "quantity": 5,
        "unitPrice": 250.00,
        "taxRate": 0,
        "glAccountId": "<services-account-id>"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "cld...",
    "invoiceNumber": "INV-000001",
    "status": "DRAFT",
    "subtotal": "11250.00",
    "taxAmount": "800.00",
    "total": "12050.00",
    "amountDue": "12050.00"
  }
}
```
> Note: subtotal = $10,000 + $1,250 (5×$250) = $11,250; tax = $10,000 × 8% = $800; total = $12,050

### 2. Approve Invoice (generates GL journal entry)

Requires `X-User-Role: CONTROLLER` — returns 403 for AR_CLERK or VIEWER.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: $TENANT_ID" \
  -H "X-User-Role: CONTROLLER" \
  -H "X-User-ID: controller-001" \
  -H "X-User-Name: Mike Controller" \
  -d '{"arAccountId": "'$AR_ACCOUNT_ID'"}'
```

  -H "X-User-ID: user-001" \
  -H "X-User-Name: Jane Accountant" \
  -d '{
    "entityId": "'$ENTITY_ID'",
    "customerId": "'$CUSTOMER_ID'",
    "amount": 5000.00,
    "method": "BANK_TRANSFER",
    "referenceNumber": "WIRE-20240715-001",
    "cashAccountId": "'$CASH_ACCOUNT_ID'",
    "arAccountId": "'$AR_ACCOUNT_ID'",
    "idempotencyKey": "pay-001"
  }'
```

### 5. Record a Payment with Manual Allocation

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/payments" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: $TENANT_ID" \
  -H "X-User-Role: AR_CLERK" \
  -H "X-User-ID: user-001" \
  -H "X-User-Name: Jane Accountant" \
  -d '{

## Architecture Decisions

### Why PostgreSQL over a document database?

Financial data is inherently relational. Invoices reference customers, line items reference GL accounts, payments link to invoices via allocation join tables. ACID transactions spanning multiple tables are non-negotiable for double-entry accounting. PostgreSQL's transaction isolation guarantees that a payment allocation either fully commits (invoice balance updated, payment status updated, GL entry created) or fully rolls back.

### Why Prisma over raw SQL?

Prisma provides compile-time type safety — if a field is renamed in the schema, every query that references it breaks at compile time, not at runtime in production. The migration system is deterministic and auditable. Raw SQL is fine for complex reporting queries; Prisma handles the entity CRUD with type safety.

### Why shared-schema multi-tenancy?

See [docs/design.md § 1.2] for the full analysis. Short version: per-tenant schemas don't scale past ~100 tenants in a single PostgreSQL instance due to catalog bloat. Row-level isolation with indexed `tenantId` is the production-proven pattern for SaaS ERP.

### Why not use a microservices architecture?

For a prototype and initial production deployment, a well-structured monolith with clear module boundaries is the right call. Microservices add operational complexity (service discovery, distributed tracing, distributed transactions) that is premature when the team is small and the domain model is still evolving. The current modular structure (`invoices/`, `payments/`, `customers/`, `gl/`, `reports/`) makes a future service extraction straightforward when the need genuinely arises.

## Key Financial Concepts Demonstrated

- **Double-entry accounting:** Every invoice approval and payment creates balanced journal entries (sum of debits = sum of credits)
- **AR subledger reconciliation:** The GL reconciliation report verifies the AR account balance equals the sum of open invoice balances
- **Invoice lifecycle state machine:** 7 states with valid transition rules enforced at service layer
- **Idempotent payment recording:** Retry-safe via idempotency keys
- **Multi-tenant isolation:** Row-level tenant discrimination on every query
- **Multi-entity hierarchy:** Parent/subsidiary structures with entity-scoped GL accounts
- **Period close enforcement:** Prevents posting to closed accounting periods
- **Complete audit trail:** Every state change recorded with user, timestamp, and old/new values
- **FIFO payment allocation:** Auto-applies payments to oldest invoices first (standard AR practice)
- **AR aging buckets:** Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days overdue
